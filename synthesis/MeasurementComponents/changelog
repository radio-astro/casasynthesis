Move to cal table v2.0
 </summary>
 <description>

Slight revisions to the existing calibration table format (v1.0),
to move to v2.0, including:

1) Full use of TableMeasures where appropriate.
2) Increase dimensionality of some columns for special solve types
   (REF_ANT and related).
3) Support PROCESSOR_ID
4) Support additional secondary MS fields.

No backwards or forwards compatibility problems are introduced by
these changes.

 <description>
Source files in MeasurementComponents and CalTables were compiled
and linked with the "-pg" option of g++.  The "calibrater" server
containing this code was executed on simulated ALMA data and the
resulting profile files were analyzed with gprof to locate code
needing optimizations.  The results were given to Kumar for further
action.
