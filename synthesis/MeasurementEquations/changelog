Performance profiling of AIPS++ simulator
 </summary>
 <description>
Tim Cornwell requested profiling be done on his script sim.g.
Added test programs tSimulator.cc and tSimulatorEND.cc
for profiling DOsimulator.cc.  Found most of the time
spent in FORTRAN fft routines.  Some parts of sim.g had
no C++ counterpart.  Overall glish and C++ timings found
to be very similar since compute-intensive parts are done
in C++.
