/*
 *  This file was originally part of the "D-Bus++ - C++ bindings for D-Bus":
 *
 *          include/dbus-cpp/eventloop-integration.h
 *
 *  I found the BusDispatcher to be... not so great. I was eventually able to
 *  get it to work. All I wanted to do was be able to wait until a signal to
 *  arrive. To do that, I had to use a "dispatcher". I did not want to hitch
 *  my wagon to glib or qt or ..., but only wanted a simple minimal dispatcher.
 *  Thus, despite admonitions to the contrary, I adopted the "BusDispatcher".
 *  the signal I was waiting for was delivered to my callback promptly, but
 *  I found that there was a pregnant pause between when I told the dispatcher
 *  to "leave( )" undoubtedly because of timeouts in polling. I tried to
 *  create a subclass of BusDispatcher, but because all of the _mutex_*
 *  were private to the DefaultMainLoop (what a mess). At that point,
 *  decided to implement my own, minimal, dispatcher. It is hard to believe
 *  this should be necessary, but apparently so.
